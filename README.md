## Introduction

A Home Assistant custom component designed to maximises solar, battery and grid usage and avoid peak rate tarriffs.

This integration will ensure that your home batteries are charged to the optimal level when the forecasted solar output drops below your daily average usage. The integration will also ensure that, given a day where the solar forecast is greater than your daily average usage, the battery has enough charge to last until dawn.

To further ease managing the battery state, the integration includes a switch to boost (+1kW) the battery charge and a second switch to charge fully; this is useful for times when you expect a higher than average load.

Example showing the integration:

- Charging the battery off-peak (3:24am -> 4:30am) as the battery wouldn't have last until dawn (i.e. when the solar takes over)
- Forecasted solar charging the battery (9:21am -> 12:20pm) up to ~80%
- Base house load consuming battery (12:20pm -> 3:25am) to a minimum of 15%
- Repeat

### Assumptions/Dependencies

These may change as development progresses:

- Only one FoxESS inverter is supported

## Installation

Recommend installation through [HACS][hacs]

1. Navigate to HACS integrations
2. Hit the menu button (top right) and select 'Custom repositories'
3. Paste this GitHub [link][foxess_em] and select 'Integration'
4. Install as usual through HACS
   - 'Explore & Download Repositories'
   - Search for 'FoxESS...'
   - Download

## Configuration and Options

<details>
    <summary><b>Solcast Setup</b></summary></p>

- **API Key**: API Key from Solcast Toolkit

![Solcast Setup](images/config-step-1.png)

</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>Inverter Connection Setup</b></summary></p>

Choose from one of the following options:

![Inverter](images/config-step-2.png)

<b>Modbus TCP (Only compatible with RTU -> TCP devices, not direct LAN)</b>

- **Modbus Host**: IP Adddress of your Modbus (i.e. W610) host
- **Modbus Port**: Port number (default 502)
- **Modbus Slave**: Slave ID (default 247)

![TCP](images/config-step-2-tcp.png)

<b>Modbus Serial</b>

- **Modbus Host**: Path to your USB host (default /dev/ttyUSB0)
- **Modbus Slave**: Slave ID (default 247)

![SERIAL](images/config-step-2-serial.png)

<b>FoxESS Cloud</b>

- **API Key**: API Key from FoxESS Cloud. To find this, go to https://www.foxesscloud.com/, select
  the User icon in the top right corner and select User Profile, then select API Management and
  generate an API key if you do not already have one.

Do not generate a new key if you have already generated one for something else (e.g.
[foxess-ha](https://github.com/macxq/foxess-ha)), as this will invalidate the previous key and you
will have to reconfigure your other uses.

    <summary><b>Battery Parameters</b></summary></p>

Enter your desired battery parameters:

- **Eco Start Time**: Start time of your off-peak period (i.e. 00:30 on Octopus Go)
- **Eco End Time**: End time of your off-peak period (i.e. 4:30 on Octopus Go)
- **Dawn Buffer**: As forecasts and usage patterns can change, leave a buffer to ensure the battery doesn't get too close to empty
- **Day Buffer**: As above, but for the day
- **Battery Capacity**: Capacity of battery in kWh
- **Minimum SoC**: Minimum State of Charge as set in the FoxESS App

If using Modbus connection:

- **Charge Rate**: Nominal charge rate in A - for a 3.6kw inverter this should be ~18A
- **Battery Volts**: Nominal battery voltage in V - i.e. 4 x HV2600 is ~220V

![Battery Params](images/config-step-3.png)

</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>Home Assistant Sensors</b></summary></p>

- **Battery SoC**: Battery State of Charge sensor - must be an integer %
- **House Power**: House load power - must be kW
- **Aux Power**: Aux sensors to remove from the house power, i.e. an Eddi, Zappi charger etc. which will skew the base house load calculations - must be W
